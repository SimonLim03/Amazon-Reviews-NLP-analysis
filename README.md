## Project Objectives and Summary
- In this technologically advanced world, businesses are expanding their market online. E-commerce is taking advantage of this opportunity by providing customers with products in the comfort of their own home.
  Online reviews are important for customers for a better understanding of the product and their purchasing decisions. Reviews can also help retailers to improve their service or product.
- This project aims to use NLP techniques to build prediction models to predict how helpful new reviews will be or gain insight into the features that influence helpfulness.
  To better understand the variety of NLP techniques, we plan to test and apply multiple NLP techniques for this project.
- EDA, text analysis, NLP technqieus (e.g., Topic modelling, K-mean clustering and Sentiment Analysis) and feature engineering for modelling have been performed to gain deeper insights on Amazon Reviews Data
- Various classification and deep neural network models have been established with the target variable 'Helpfulness' score (e.g., 0 for unhelpful reviews and 1 for helpful reviews)
- The predicted outcomes would provide potential insights into Amazon foods industry and providing recommendations. By focusing on the text contents of the reviews as input into models, users can benefit from seeing predictions on the helpfulness of reviews before posting. Meanwhile companies like Amazon can bring more visibility to helpful reviews that are too new to gather many human votes, from new users that have yet to build a significant track record, or for products that are niche. This potentially provides another avenue for overcoming the cold-start problem.
