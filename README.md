## Project Objectives
- In this technologically advanced world, businesses are expanding their market online. E-commerce is taking advantage of this opportunity by providing customers with products in the comfort of their own home.
  Online reviews are important for customers for a better understanding of the product and their purchasing decisions. Reviews can also help retailers to improve their service or product.
- This project aims to use NLP techniques to build prediction models to predict how helpful new reviews will be or gain insight into the features that influence helpfulness.
  To better understand the variety of NLP techniques, we plan to test and apply multiple NLP techniques for this assignment.
